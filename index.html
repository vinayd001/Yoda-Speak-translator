        <p>Convert from English to Yoda speak. Yoda often orders sentences as Object-Subject-Verb, 
            split verbs, switches entire phrases and sometimes uses sentences that are different from 
            his normal syntax! Because of this it is difficult to accurately represent his sentence structure.
            Have fun and may the force be with you! Yoda is a registered trademark of Disney.
